## Release

- Error page style - reference https://laravel.com/whatever.com (update markup in error.html).
- Footer Navigation - text links will include terms and conditions, privacy policy, FAQ, drop twitter and email
- Need a Sign Out link/icon when user is logged in. Ideally I'd like to keep the header clean (no nav).
- Add testimonials and potention screen shot - reference https://ottomatik.io/#quotes
- Footer links hover/active state needs to be more readable

## Backlog
- *Pricing* styles. On the order page, still need to adjust the purchase button to include price.
- Add Payment page to order flow. Now that we are adding Paypal, I believe we should add a Payment page to the order flow. This will likely just be a short order review and then buttons to Pay with Card and Pay with PayPal.
- Revisit order pages styles for quick design wins and consistency
