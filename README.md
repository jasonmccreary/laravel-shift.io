# laravel-shift.io

## TODO
- Add favicon. Should be consistent with the [GitHub avatar](https://github.com/laravel-shift).
- Action buttons states seem backwards. Should be muted, then highlight on hover. Also, double check the color, it seems more red than the rest of the site
- *Pricing* styles. On the home page, I want to draw out the price with a potential sale price. On the order page, the price does not need to be as drawn out. Maybe it could be in the button, e.g. "Buy for $7"
- Product headers. Let's increase the circle and font sizes of the product headers.
- *How It Works* spacing and alignment. This section needs to be more readable. Some minor spacing adjustments to match the *Pricing* section should do. Also, double check that the icons are similarly sized and aligned.
- Footer adjustments:
    - Aligned to the bottom (reference order.html)
    - Add icons for Twitter and Email
    - Add wording to give us credit, e.g. Created by JMac and CootsDaddy
- Review FAQ page styles/markup. This is the only page with lots of content.
- Review "tagline" styles and markup. I use these throughout the site. Just a quick one-liner, centered, often starting in bold and ending with an action (reference "Try before you buy..." on index.html)
- Revisit inner page header styles. Maybe center, better padding, etc.
- Link styles for "Shift" on inner page banner.
- Revisit checkout page style. The form is too large. Maybe 
- Payment page. Now that we are adding Paypal, I believe we should add a Payment page to the order flow. This will likely just be a short order review and then buttons to Pay with Card and Pay with PayPal.
- Revisit confirmation page. I just made this in a hurry. Could stand for a redesign.
