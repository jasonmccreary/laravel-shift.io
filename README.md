## TODO

- Error page style (see error.html).
- Need to inject a sign out link somewhere in the site.
- *Pricing* styles. On the order page, still need to adjust the purchase button to include price.
- Footer icons are really large.
- Footer links hover/active state needs to be more readable
- Revisit checkout page.
- Payment page. Now that we are adding Paypal, I believe we should add a Payment page to the order flow. This will likely just be a short order review and then buttons to Pay with Card and Pay with PayPal.
- Revisit confirmation page. I just made this in a hurry. Could stand for a redesign.
