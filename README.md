## TODO

- Error page style (see error.html).
- Navigation - needs to include terms and conditions, privacy policy, FAQ
- Need a Sign Out link/icon when user is logged in.
- *Pricing* styles. On the order page, still need to adjust the purchase button to include price.
- Revisit footer icons (too large).
- Footer links hover/active state needs to be more readable
- Add Payment page to order flow. Now that we are adding Paypal, I believe we should add a Payment page to the order flow. This will likely just be a short order review and then buttons to Pay with Card and Pay with PayPal.
- Revisit order pages styles for quick design wins and consistency
- Add testimonials and potention screen shot - reference http://nitpick-ci.com
